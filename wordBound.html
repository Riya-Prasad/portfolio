					<div class="project-info">
						This app is more than just a platform for reading—it’s a personalized gateway into a universe of books. With a vast library spanning genres, authors, and cultures, the
						app offers tailored recommendations, reading goals, and a thriving community of book lovers.
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="flex">
					<div class="project-subheading">My Role</div>
					<div class="project-info">
						As the lead UX/UI designer, I was tasked with crafting an experience that would not only entice users to read more but also transform the way they engage with books
						digitally. My approach centered on personalization, intuitive navigation, and creating a community feel within the app.
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="flex">
					<div class="challenge-heading">Challenges</div>
					<div class="flex">
						<div class="challenge-subheading">• Overwhelming Choice:</div>
						<div class="challenge-info">With so many books available, users found it hard to discover titles that suited their preferences.</div>
					</div>
					<div class="flex">
						<div class="challenge-subheading">• Low Engagement:</div>
						<div class="challenge-info">Users needed motivation to stay consistent with their reading goals.</div>
					</div>
					<div class="flex">
						<div class="challenge-subheading">• Community Building:</div>
						<div class="challenge-info">The app lacked a sense of interaction and connection among readers.</div>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="flex">
					<div class="challenge-heading">Solution</div>
					<div class="flex">
						<div class="challenge-info">
							• I introduced a personalized recommendation engine to help users discover books based on their reading habits and preferences, displayed in an easy-to-browse
							carousel format that feels tailored to each user.
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="flex">
						<div class="challenge-info">
							• Designed a gamified progress tracker, allowing users to set reading goals and earn badges and milestones, creating a sense of achievement and encouraging daily
							interaction.
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="flex">
						<div class="challenge-info">
							• For a more immersive experience, I implemented “quick reads” for users with limited time, showcasing short stories or excerpts tailored to their interests, ensuring
							users stay engaged even on a tight schedule.
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="flex">
						<div class="challenge-info">
							• I created a digital reading community hub, with features like book clubs, discussion forums, and user-generated reviews, fostering interaction among readers and
							providing a social element to an otherwise solitary activity.
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="flex">
					<div class="challenge-heading">Outcome</div>
					<div class="flex">
						<div class="challenge-info">• User engagement increased by 30% with the implementation of personalized recommendations and reading goals.</div>
						<div class="challenge-info">
							• The community features led to a 25% rise in users joining book clubs and participating in discussions, making the app a go-to for avid readers looking for
							connection.
