                Wordbound has been designed as an innovative reading app to

                Tackling challenges like overwhelming book choices, low
                engagement, and lack of community, I introduced a personalized
                recommendation engine, a gamified progress tracker, and features
                like “quick reads” for busy users. The addition of a digital
                community hub, including book clubs and forums, fostered reader
                connections. These enhancements increased user engagement by 30%
                and boosted community participation by 25%, making the app a hub
                for book lovers. This project showcases my expertise in UX
                design, user engagement strategies, and digital community
                building.
