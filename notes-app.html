        <div class="project-heading">Main Challenges:</div>
        <div class="project-info">
          <div class="project-subheading">Limited Personalization:</div>
          Many note-taking apps lack the flexibility to personalize notes to
          individual preferences. Users often find themselves restricted to
          plain text, unable to visually distinguish between different types of
          notes or categorize them effectively.
          <br />
          <div class="project-subheading">Inadequate Media Integration:</div>
          With the growing need to include multimedia content in notes, such as
          images, documents, and links, users often resort to cumbersome
          workarounds. Existing apps fail to provide a streamlined and intuitive
          way to incorporate these elements.
          <br />
          <div class="project-subheading">Poor Organization:</div>
          The increasing volume of digital notes makes it crucial to have a
          robust organizational structure. Many note-taking apps fall short in
          this aspect, making it challenging for users to sort, categorize, and
          retrieve their notes efficiently. Limited
          <br />
          <div class="project-subheading">Collaboration Features:</div>
          Collaboration is a fundamental aspect of modern work and education.
          Note-taking apps often lack features for seamless sharing and
          collaborative editing, forcing users to rely on external tools.
          <br />
          <div class="project-subheading">User Experience Barriers:</div>
          Learning curves and unintuitive interfaces deter many potential users
          from adopting digital note-taking apps. These barriers hinder the
          transition from traditional methods to digital solutions.
          <br />
          <div class="project-subheading">Security Concerns:</div>
          Protecting sensitive information in digital notes is paramount. Users
          need reassurance that their data is secure, yet some note-taking apps
          may fall short in terms of data encryption and backup options.
